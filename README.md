# website
Welcome to the README for this website's source code. I host the source code of my website so others can look at my website and learn from it.
The link to a hosted version is at [Link Here](https://lschaefer.xyz) You are welcome to use the source code in any of your own projects.
I would not recommend for any user to try to recreate this setup because it is a very custom setup.

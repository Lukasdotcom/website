# website
Welcome to the README for this website's source code. I host the source code of my website so others can look at my website and learn from it.
The link to a hosted version is at [Link Here](https://lschaefer.xyz)![](https://uptime.lschaefer.xyz/api/badge/1/uptime/720?label=30&labelSuffix=d) You are welcome to use the source code in any of your own projects.
Also this contains the source code for my cookie clicker addon to use this just follow the directions at [Link Here](https://lschaefer.xyz/cookieClicker/).
If you want to recreate this use the docker container and run it on an RPI4. The docker container with steps on how to use it is [here](https://github.com/Lukasdotcom/dockerWebsite).
